# Snake-Eyes simulations
 Simulation of Snake Eyes problem, but 1/36 chance is replaced with 0.75

 For the purpose of making simultions not overflow population, the 1/36 chance of deathroll is replaced with 0.75. That is done because 1/36 is an arbitrary number, which does not affect how problem is solved.
